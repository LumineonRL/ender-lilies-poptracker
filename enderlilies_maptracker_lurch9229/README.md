Logic for the Verboten Domain that involves going through blight is currently set to needing mask, or having 3 priestess' wishes, spellbound anklet, 150+hp (this includes health boosts from Soiled Prayer Beads and Royal Aegis Curio (not the unused health relic)) and 5 relic slots, or having 150+hp, holy water, spellbound anklet and 6 relic slots along with movement needed to each check or 120HP guardians wings (dodge upgrade) and dash (from Julius) with 3 wishes.

Logic to get through the Abyss Hell Run is set to needing 300+hp, spellbound anklet, ruined witches book, 6 wishes and 7 relic slots. This needs more vigorus testing so please let me know if you find over ways to get through gauntlet. Thanks.

I hope you enjoy using this tracker alongside your rando playthroughs. Good Luck, Have Fun everyone.

How to use Poptracker

1. Add the Ender Lilies Tracker .zip (packed) into your poptracker\packs folder
2. Click on the folder in the top left and navigate to the Ender Lilies tracker and select the variant you want to use (more infomation below)
3. Next we need to select our settings. Click on the settings option next to UAT. This will bring up a popout with settings to select from including shuffles and Starting Location.
4. You should now have a bunch of red and green boxes all over the maps. Lets talk about those. Green are locations you can reach with your current itemset. Red shows areas you can not reach. Sometimes you may see Orange boxes. These show that you can get some items in a given area but not all of them. There is also a Yellow box which is used for showing locations you can reach by breaking logic, but currently the tracker does not account for these yet.
5. After you have defeated some bosses such as Siegrid, Gerrod and Ulv it is important to check these off as done. Code is written to unlock access past these bosses and currently map locations do not update automatically.
6. If you want to use the auto-tracker feature then be sure to check the box in livesplit to send items to poptracker. This allows the game and poptracker to communicate item pickups in real-time and update gained items automatically. If the autotracker and game are connected the UAT displayed will turn from red to green.
7. Poptracker has a broadcast view designed to be used as a display on streams and videos. You can open this popout window by click the button next to the settings button in the top left corner.
